I. Dependencies.

For database you must have a MySQL server installation version 4.x or 5.x:
Fedora Core 6: yum install mysql-server mysql
Fedora 8: yum install mysql-server mysql
ALTLinux Compact 3.0: apt-get install MySQL-server MySQL-client
ALTLinux Desktop 4.0: apt-get install MySQL-server 

For web-frontend you must have Apache and PHP 5 with PDO and multibyte
extensions:
Fedora Core 6: # yum install httpd php php-mysql php-pdo php-gd
Fedora 8: yum install httpd php php-mysql php-pdo php-gd php-snmp php-mbstring
ALTLinux Server 4.0: apt-get install apache2-httpd-prefork php5-gd2 \
php5-pdo_mysql php5-pdo apache2-mod_php5 php5-mbstring

II. Prepare the server.
1. Unpack the tarball and make it web-accessible, e.g. http://yourcompany.com/racktables
or http://racktables.mysite.org.
2. mysql> create database_name; grant all privileges on database_name.* to XXX@YYY identified by 'ZZZ';


There are two mutually exclusive ways to install RackTables, they are described as III-A and III-B.


III-A. HTTP installation (starting with 0.14.12 release)
Open your RackTables URL and follow the instructions. In a suitable
environment everything should take a minute or so.


III-B. Manual installation.
1. Edit install/init-auth.sql and change admin password

2. Init database.
mysql> use database_name;
mysql> source install/init-structure.sql
mysql> source install/init-auth.sql
$ rm -f install/init-auth.sql
mysql> source install/init-dictbase.sql
mysql> source install/init-dictvendors.sql

3. Edit inc/secret.php

4. $ rm -f install/init-auth.sql
(Just to be sure you did.)

RackTables now provides an automatic database upgrade feature.
If you already have a working installation, the following
procedure should be sufficient:

0. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE
1. Remove all existing files except inc/secret.php and gateways'
   configuration (in the gateways directory).
2. Unpack the new tarball into the place.
3. Open the RackTables page in your browser.
4. Follow instructions. Normally, everything should be Ok. If it
   is not so, write down the failed quieries for further investigation.

*** Upgrading to 0.14.12 ***

The upgrade may show a failed query "alter database character set utf8", in
this case the user should issue the query manually from the mysql command
line.

*** Upgrading to 0.16.0 ***

This release features a completely new authorization system, RackCode,
which brings the tags feature (introduced in 0.15.0) to its full potential.
The old-style user permissions are converted during upgrade automatically,
but the result may appear not what you would expect. Review the RackCode
after upgrade (Main page -> Configuration -> Permissions) and adjust,
if necessary.

Another important change is a new dependency on "multibyte string" PHP
extension. Normally one should get it working before starting the upgrade,
this is typically achieved by installing a particular PHP RPM from the
standard package repository (and restarting Apache after that):

Fedora: yum install php-mbstring
ALTLinux: apt-get install php5-mbstring
