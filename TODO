======RackTables status
=====TODO list
The features marked with [UI] must have a configuration option accessible from the user inteface page, so that a user could disable them. The items tagged with [AD] come from Aaron's TODO list.
----
====Minor features missing
* add reports
 * connected objects w/o rackspace
 * all objects of certain types w/o asset tag/common name
 * connected objects in distinct rack rows
 * last history entries
 * warranty expiration
 * list of all object stickers
 * orphaned stickers
----
====Internals
* Use printLog() in assertion functions.
* Use a separate flag for rail problems in RackObject.
* Use user ID instead of username where possible.
* Search function is called 4 times per 1 search (see functions.php).
* renderIPRange() could use printRefsOfType()
* Should getObjectAddressesAndNames() be replaced with getObjectAddresses()?
* Check that ophandlers.php:addNewRange() employs assertions properly.
* Clean up pagehandlers.php from pointless endless case constructs (most probably with a help of new "tabhandler" navigation index).
* Look if foreach(getPortTypes()) can be replaced with more standard printSelect()
----
====Infrastructure issues
* Publish commented screenshots on the main web-site, so people can better understand what the project is about.
* The project needs a wikispace and a bug tracker; Trac seems to be the proper solution for this, but with a tricky installation procedure. Anyway, we have to wait till the new hosting server is ready to find out, which tools can be used for documentation and bug tracking.
