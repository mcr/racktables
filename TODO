====Internals
* Use printLog() in assertion functions.
* Use a separate flag for rail problems in RackObject.
* Use user ID instead of username where possible.
* Search function is called 4 times per 1 search (see functions.php).
* renderIPRange() could use printRefsOfType()
* Should getObjectAddressesAndNames() be replaced with getObjectAddresses()?
* Check that ophandlers.php:addNewRange() employs assertions properly.
* Clean up pagehandlers.php from pointless endless case constructs (most probably with a help of new "tabhandler" navigation index).
* Look if foreach(getPortTypes()) can be replaced with more standard printSelect()
