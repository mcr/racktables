RackTables now provides an automatic database upgrade feature.
If you already have a working installation, the following
procedure should be sufficient:

0. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE
1. Remove all existing files except inc/secret.php and gateways'
   configuration (in the gateways directory).
2. Unpack the new tarball into the place.
3. Open the RackTables page in your browser.
4. Follow instructions. Normally, everything should be Ok. If it
   is not so, write down the failed quieries for further investigation.
